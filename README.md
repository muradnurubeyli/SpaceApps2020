# Space Apps 2020
NASA Space Apps 2020 - Regional Elimination Round

EcoPrints is an eco-friendly social media platform that both educate and raise peoples awareness about ecological problems and pursue them for more eco friendly, recyclable lifestyle. In our app people not only could choose and complete various ecological challenges, such as recycling paper, walking or riding instead of driving, or getting energy only from renewable methods like solar, wind, water energy but also they can challenge their friends and make them eco friendly as well.

So we decided to reward our users as well- when they complete challenges they will earn “green feet” and depending on challenge’s importance the amount of “green feet” will vary. Users could exchange these feet for various rewards such as discounts or free products from famous shops and sites.

We participated in NASA Space Apps with this idea. Our main project developed with ASP.NET Core, React JS, Python - Jupyter Notebook (for Data analysis and Visualisation).
We have explained our purpose in the first elimination round. Full project will be available in world finals.
